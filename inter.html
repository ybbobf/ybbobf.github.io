				</h2>
				
				I finished a 2 year associate degree in Computer System Design and Programming.
<br>
I have over 5 years of Technical Support Experience with the main focus in cumputer software and hardware troubleshooting.
<br>
My first experience was at Sutherland in Quezon City. I was in the Lenovo Warranty Services account. We did software and hardware troubleshooting to try and fix any software related issues. Then if it has been isolated as a hardware fault or a hardware issue then we'll assist the customer with the warranty. Back then, we'll simply send them a return label for free so they can send the computer to the nearest repair facility.
<br>
Then I transfered to Reimage Philippines in Makati City. I worked as there as part of the advanced technical support team. We assisted customers with almost any software and hardware related issues that they may have. That includes, Windows/Mac/Linux Troubleshooting, Windows Updates, driver installation, system optimization, virus removal, BSODs, printer setup and troubleshooting, home networking issues, backup, Microsoft Office issues, and also any 3rd party software issues that's not account related.
<br>
Then I worked next at Topdata Global in Angeles City. I worked in their consumer VPN account as a Technical Support Representative. We assisted customers with any issues that are related to the VPN software, that includes the VPN setup, settings issues, or connection issues.

					What is my greatest Strength?
				</h3>
				<p class="answers-h2">
					I am passionate about technology and computers. I love learning new things and I learn things pretty quickly. And for me this is more not just you average daily work but this is also something that I actually enjoy doing.

				</p>
				<p>
I am very patient. I am probably the most patient person that I know. I like to listen to people to understand them and learn why they do what they do. I believe that there is always a reason why someone does something. It doesn’t really matter if it is a simple reason or a complicated reason because it depends on the person’s emotional state at the time.

				<h3 class="questions-h2">
					What's your biggest weakness?
				</h3>
				<p class="answers-h2">
					My biggest weakness is the fact that I don't yet have much experience in talking to large groups of people. This is something I am very keen to improve on, so if any opportunities were to arise in this position to gain experience in this area, I would certainly want to take advantage of that.

			<div class="questions-section">
				<h3 class="questions-h2">
					How would other people describe you?
				</h3>
				<p class="answers-h2">
					I belive my previous colleagues would describe me as someone they could turn to whenever they needed assistance or someone they could rely on to help them out at short notice and someone who has a can-do attitude.
